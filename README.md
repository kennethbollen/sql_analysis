Good Summary for One ColumnFor exploring data, the following information is a good summary for a single column:		The number of distinct values in the column;		Minimum and maximum values;		An example of the most common value (called the mode in statistics);		An example of the least common value (called the antimode);		Frequency of the minimum and maximum values;		Frequency of the mode and antimode;		Number of values that occur only one time;		Number of modes (because the most common value is not necessarily unique); and,		Number of antimodes.
